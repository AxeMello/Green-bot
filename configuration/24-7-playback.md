# 24/7 playback

If you don't want Green-bot to leave your voice channel when it's empty, you can enable the 24/7 mode.

The 24/7 mode is entirely free. You just need to vote to access the command.&#x20;

Vote link: [https://green-bot.app/vote](https://green-bot.app/vote)

Command: `{prefix}24/7`

Don't forget to replace {prefix} by your prefix

If the 24/7 mode is already enabled, it will disable it. Else it will enable it

When you enable the 24/7 mode, it's for all the next queues.
