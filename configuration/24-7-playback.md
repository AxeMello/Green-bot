# 24/7 playback

If you don't want Green-bot to leave your voice channel when it's empty, you can enable the 24/7 mode.

You can enable it by using the 24/7 command: `*24/7`

Don't forget to use your right prefix

If the 24/7 mode is already enabled, it will disable it. Else it will enable it

When you enable the 24/7 mode, it's for all the next queues.
