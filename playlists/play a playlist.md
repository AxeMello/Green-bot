#Play your playlist

To play your own playlist type the command: `*pl-play name` or `*pl-p name`
(change name to your playlists name)

For this you should have a playlist created and make sure to type your playlists name correctly

After you type this command, the bot will add all the tracks in your playlist to the queue
