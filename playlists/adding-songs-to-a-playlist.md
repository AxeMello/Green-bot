# Adding songs to a playlist

You can add songs to the playlist you created by typing the command: `*pl-add name song` (change name to your playlists name) (change song to the songs name you want to add, or the spotify / youtube / soundcloud link)

After typing the above command the bot should say "Successfully added 1 track(s) to name"

You can add as many songs as you like or even add a spotify playlist to your own playlist on Green-bot
